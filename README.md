# GraphEffect 3 Static HTML and CSS
Carlos' first Shift project, yay! Static pages/states, images and CSS for the new GE3. 

I totally took the framework from Chris Lorenz's Brunch-Drank repo. But I'll still totally take all the credit.

Simply open index.html and navigate a world of wonder and merriment!
